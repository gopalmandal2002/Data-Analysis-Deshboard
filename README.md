Connected data from multiple sources (if applicable) such as Excel sheets.
### Data Cleaning
Removed null values and duplicates.
Formatted date fields, corrected item categories, and standardized rating formats.
Ensured consistency across outlet sizes, locations, and product labels.
### Data Transformation
Created calculated columns and measures using DAX.
Built relationships between tables (e.g., item type, outlet details).
Aggregated metrics for KPIs like total sales, average sales, and item counts.
### Data Modeling
Structured the data model using star schema principles for efficient reporting.
Applied filters and slicers for outlet type, size, location, and item type.
### Data Visualization
Designed an interactive dashboard using charts (bar, line, pie), KPIs, and cards.
Visualized trends like sales over time, sales by outlet tier, and product category analysis.
Enabled drill-downs and slicers for deeper insights.
### Insights & Reporting
Highlighted key performance indicators (KPIs) for business understanding.
Helped identify high-performing outlets and low-visibility items.
